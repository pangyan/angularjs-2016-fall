a very exciting game.....
all participants dedicate themselves in the game, it's very wonderful to be there......


2. Difficulties on Past Case Study

Our request: files of past cases, to study how ICAC can solve a case, or the method they work as a team, 
organizing a investigation, collecting evidence, and finally charging.

Result: rejected, due to confidential reason.

Our second approach: request for newspaper cutting collected by ICAC.

Result: okay, but not enough.

Our third approach: request for video which is past case...

finally, we lend some video (TV- Drama Series 25 Years ATV Re-Run) and study the characteristis of ICAC's
promotion of message through media rather than study the characteristic of ICAC's investgation skill, although the 
video are from real case...
